# Our project

when you find this. you should make a clone on your machine and then you can work on it. 

we should organize who works on what so we don't work on the same thing at the same time. 

then you can just make your changes and then push it up. hopefully we can make sure eveything works properly together.

this will be just for notes. if your working on styles. then make a note here and push it up so no one else works on styles with you. just for anything popular.
also if your going to be away for a while so we know.
just check in here every once in a while.

if you need to ask questions. just text the group chat.
